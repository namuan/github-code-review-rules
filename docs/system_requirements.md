# System Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

A system that collects, processes, and analyzes GitHub pull request (PR) comments to generate coding rules. The system will be used to improve code quality and enforce coding standards automatically.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Data Collector Module

**FR-DC-01**: Connect to GitHub API to retrieve closed pull requests

- Must authenticate with GitHub API using appropriate credentials
- Must be able to paginate through all closed PRs
- Must handle rate limiting gracefully

**FR-DC-02**: Collect comprehensive review data for each closed PR

- Extract review comments with context
- Capture surrounding code snippets
- Record date/time information
- Collect comment thread data
- Store all collected data in a database

**FR-DC-03**: Data persistence

- Must store collected data in a structured database
- Must include metadata about source PR and repository
- Must support efficient querying for analysis

### 2.2 Data Analysis Module

**FR-DA-01**: Rule extraction using LLM

- For each collected PR entry, send data to LLM
- Prompt LLM to extract application-specific coding rules
- Parse and structure the extracted rules
- Save rules to database with associated review details

**FR-DA-02**: Rule management

- Store extracted rules with metadata
- Maintain relationship between rules and source PRs
- Support rule categorization and tagging

### 2.3 Data Presentation Module

**FR-DP-01**: Web interface

- Present database data in a user-friendly web UI
- Display extracted coding rules
- Show source PR information and context
- No authentication required for basic access

**FR-DP-02**: Data visualization

- Display rules in an organized, searchable format
- Show rule statistics and trends
- Provide filtering capabilities

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance Requirements

**NF-PERF-01**: System responsiveness

- Web UI should load within 3 seconds
- Data collection should handle large repositories efficiently
- LLM processing should have reasonable response times

**NF-PERF-02**: Scalability

- System should handle increasing volumes of PR data
- Database should support efficient querying as data grows

### 3.2 Reliability Requirements

**NF-REL-01**: Data integrity

- All collected data must be stored without corruption
- System should handle API failures gracefully
- Database transactions should be atomic

**NF-REL-02**: Error handling

- System should provide meaningful error messages
- Failed operations should be logged for debugging
- System should recover from temporary failures

### 3.3 Security Requirements

**NF-SEC-01**: API security

- GitHub API credentials must be securely stored
- System should not expose sensitive information
- Database access should be properly secured

### 3.4 Maintainability Requirements

**NF-MNT-01**: Code quality

- Code should follow established coding standards
- System should be well-documented
- Components should be modular and testable

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (recommended for LLM integration)
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **API Integration**: GitHub API v3/v4
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI API or compatible service

### 4.2 Data Storage Requirements

- Store PR metadata (repository, PR number, title, etc.)
- Store review comments with context
- Store code snippets
- Store extracted rules with metadata
- Store timestamps and audit trails
- Use SQLite file-based database for easy deployment and backup

### 4.3 External Dependencies

- GitHub API access token
- LLM service API access
- Database server (SQLite recommended)

## 5. Success Criteria

1. System can successfully connect to GitHub API and collect PR data
2. System can extract meaningful coding rules from PR comments
3. Web UI presents data in an organized, user-friendly manner
4. System handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback
5. All stored data remains consistent and queryable
